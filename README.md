# Farm Vibes ðŸŒ±

A cozy CLI farming simulator built with Go and TDD.

## Current Status

- âœ… Basic game structure with 5x5 farm grid
- âœ… Crop system (Carrots, Tomatoes, Corn) with prices and growth times
- âœ… Player inventory and shop system with `BuySeeds()`
- ðŸš§ **WIP**: Planting, watering, harvesting mechanics
- ðŸš§ **WIP**: Sleep/time progression system

## TDD Journey Test

Our main test (`TestFarmingJourney`) tells the complete story:
1. Try to buy expensive seeds â†’ insufficient funds error
2. Buy affordable seeds â†’ success
3. Plant seeds â†’ uses inventory and energy
4. Water crops â†’ costs energy
5. Sleep â†’ advance time, restore energy, grow crops
6. Harvest â†’ earn money, clear plots

## Next Steps

Run failing tests to see what needs implementing:
```bash
go test -v
```

Currently missing: `PlantSeed()`, `WaterPlot()`, `Sleep()`, `HarvestPlot()`

## Run Game

```bash
go run main.go
```
